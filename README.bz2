PLEASE: Whether using or updating the general files of Team 2374,
READ THIS DOCUMENT.

In SVN format, please save ALL files meant to be opened by the xp98
text editor be saved as .bz2
Write the file extension to the first line in brackets, do not 
assume everybody will know how a file is used.
All other file types are left the way they are.

All users have utmost courtesy of others work. I will
make weekly backups of the svn, and any foolishness such as dropping
a 420 GB jpeg into a project folder is not going to be tolerated and
will be rolled back. Any project members can contact me in order to
have their folder's content manually backed up.

How to contribute:
Make a folder called Upload or whatever, it does not really matter
what the name of it is. Now, if you are uploading a file to the svn,
first determine where the hell it will go, and then create the
substructure within Upload. Therefore, if the directory is:
Trunk/MAINDIR/SUBDIR/MAYBEDIR/SWAN, then the substructure of the
folder you add will be: Upload/MAINDIR/SUBDIR/MAYBEDIR/SWAN. Then
within the fictional SWAN, place the file. Right click the Upload
folder, and click add under the subtab Tortoise SVN. Everything 
should be checked. Then click ok. "EUBFHUJVEYHNFIEUYFH nothing 
happened!", you may exclaim in annoyance, but this is ok. Right
click the folder AGAIN, and under Tortoise SVN, click commit.
You will be prompted for password and username. The username is me,
Palmpou, and the password fluctuates weekly (or biweekly). Every
time I archive the SVN, the password is updated here but in rare 
situations, it may change. In that case, you may contact me to
obtain the current password through me either with email, in person,
or my Steam account.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR ADDING HOOKS.
Triple check to make sure a filename is not already taken. If it is,
rename your file. Dont make it a rev because it is not the same
file. This is common sense, and one should not such a reminder, but
there we go. Also, make sure that the file really needs to be added.
Do not add temporary files, it adds bulk.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR UPDATING HOOKS.
Save in revisions. Please. My rollbacks will not save everything,
and the fewer that need to be done, the better. If there is a file
that needs to be overriden, then resave revisions under something
else. (ie style.css that you dont want to bs each time)
When you commit, add descriptive comments. Not 'rwjrekjrberbgeyr'.

GENERAL CHECKOUT GUIDELINES.
Get to the directory you want in the web browser, then copy and
use that url. Dont download the full thing. The Z: drive gets
full the full svn, and it UPDATES the full svn each day.

Data hierarchy by date:

0. team2374
1. Contributions by viewers like you.
2. Z:Drive
3. An average subversion checkout
4. Pamlpou's backup
5. Somebody who has not contributed for a while

A good rule of thumb is to contact the contributer rather than
me when a dependency is gone, especially when taking the 
hierarchy in to account.
After hopefully reading everything, I hope you are all set to
use the new subversion system!
