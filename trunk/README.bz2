Unless you are gainfully employed, this shall not mean much to you.
In SVN format, please save ALL files meant to be opened by the xp98
text editor be saved as .bz2
Write the file extension to the first line in brackets, do not 
assume everybody will know how a file is used.
All other file types are left the way they are.

WHEN ADDING HOOKS OR FOLDERS: Please please navigate the svn in
order to determine that A: The folder already exists and B:
that you save in a revision or have the decency to check if a
file is stored under the same name. IF IT IS SOMETHING NEW:
Name it in such a fashion that its purpose is easily discovered
for others or will remind you what the file or folder itself 
contains. If not, include a readme file determining the contents
of the folder. Yes, it is fun to name directories SUN_TZU but 
in practice it is an utter pain to decrypt 2 months later when
it is opened to only find some serial dynamic link libraries.

THE JHS GAMEMAKER TEAMS WILL ALSO UTILIZE PARTITIONS OF 
team2374 UNLESS IT IS DEEMED STUPID AND SUPERFICIAL.
This means all users have utmost courtesy of others work. I will
make weekly backups of the svn, and any foolishness such as dropping
a 420 GB jpeg into a project folder is not going to be tolerated and
will be rolled back. Any project members can contact me in order to
have their folder's content manually backed up.

IF YOU NEED TO ADD ANYTHING, CONTACT ME, YES ME.
The password changes constantly and its listing here may not be up
to scratch.
